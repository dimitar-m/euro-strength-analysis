# Tracking Euro Strength: A Visual Journey Through 25 Years of Currency Trends

Welcome to my data analysis project, "Tracking Euro Strength". This project provides a detailed examination of the euro-dollar exchange rate and the currency transitions of various nations adopting the euro over the past 25 years. By leveraging a range of data visualizations, the project highlights the relationship between significant EU events and currency value changes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is twofold:
1. **Visualizing Euro-Dollar Exchange Rate Changes During EU Events**: To illustrate how key EU events, such as enlargements and Brexit, have influenced the euro-dollar exchange rate. This includes tracking fluctuations around the Fifth Enlargement, Sixth Enlargement, Seventh Enlargement, and Brexit.
2. **Analyzing National Currencies' Exchange Rates Leading Up to Euro Adoption**: To analyze and visualize the exchange rate trends of national currencies before they adopted the euro. This covers countries such as Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

## Key Questions Addressed
- How did EU enlargements and Brexit affect the euro-dollar exchange rate?
- What were the exchange rate trends of national currencies against the euro before their adoption?
- Were there any significant patterns or unique behaviors observed in the currency transitions?

## Summary of Findings
- Trends and patterns in the euro-dollar exchange rate around significant EU events.
- Pre-adoption currency stability and fluctuations for countries transitioning to the euro.
- Comparative insights into different national currencies and their exchange rate behaviors leading up to euro adoption.
